<h2> Personal favorites from John &amp; Giny:</h2>

<p>Friends have asked us to share some of our favorite things to do in and around <em>Florence</em> &#40;<strong>Firenze</strong>&#41;. Guidebooks are best for making strategic use of limited time. Perhaps an idea or two from our experience will grab you, or maybe you&#39;ll be in Florence long enough to wonder, &#8220;What should we do today&#63;&#8221;  Italian is in <strong>bold</strong>, English equivalents in <em>italics</em>, and links are <span class="simlink">underlined</span>. </p>
<h3> A couple of the biggies:</h3>


<p>Giny’s favorite museum&#8211;<a href="http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/english/musei/bargello/" title="website for the Bargello"><strong>The Bargello</strong></a>, via del Proconsolo 4, Florence’s oldest public building and with typical medieval features, is filled with sculpture, mainly from the 15th &amp; 16th centuries. Giny doesn’t get too excited about large museums. The family joke is that her memory of visiting the Uffizzi was her tired ooo&#45;feetsy. But she likes the Bargello, maybe because it is laid out rather loosely, not a sequence one must follow. You can simply go this way or that.</p>

<p>John&#39;s museum highlight&#58;<strong> Museo dell’Opera del Duomo </strong>&#40;links below&#41;&#8212;<em>the Museum of the Works of the Duomo</em>, at Piazza del Duomo 9. Here, historic elements from the duomo complex&#8212;the baptistery, the campanile and the <strong>duomo</strong>,<em> cathedral&#8212;</em>are displayed and preserved along with related historical displays. My pick for the most powerful sculpture in Florence is Donatello&#39;s sculpture of Mary Magdalene. Its traditional home has been this museum, but it was in the Bargello when we visited in 2008, perhaps to have work done on it. Michelangelo’s unfinished Piet&agrave; supposedly features his aged face as Nicodemus. An easy read about the development of the Renaissance is <em>Brunelleschi’s Dome</em> by Ross King. It will enhance your enjoyment of this museum. Here are the component&#39;s <a href="http://www.operaduomo.firenze.it/english/opera/orari.asp?">hours</a>, and here is the <a href="http://www.operaduomo.firenze.it/english/luoghi/museo.asp" title="Site for the Museum of the works of the duomo">museum&#39;s site</a>. The <strong>operai</strong>, the lay institution in charge of everything, is an ongoing group. </p>
<h3>Less well&#45;known spots in Florence:</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/english/musei/davanzati/Default.asp?"><strong>Palazzo Davanzati</strong></a>, Via Porta Rossi 13. This home has been restored to its medieval style- a step further back in time from famously Renaissance Florence. Decorative and colorful, with period furnishings, this will be especially interesting to designers and architects. </p>
<p>English language movies at the Odeon, Piazza Strozzi, 2.  &#8220;Original language&#8221; movies in English are regularly offered in this classic old theatre&#47;performance hall where a plush if faded seat is always available, along with wine and beer at concessions. Click the <em>Odeon Original Sound</em> box at <a href="http://www.cinehall.it/pagine/programmazione.asp"><strong>the Odeon site</strong></a> for the listing of English language movies. For some reason we enjoy movies set in Europe the most.</p>
<p>My soul was stirred at the modest Oratorio dei Buonomini di San Martino, located where via de&#8217; Magazzini meets via Dante Alighieri. This is only a single room with frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio &#40;or his workshop&#41;. The Oratorio is on no one&#8217;s list of things to see. It continues its charitable work- <strong>buonomini</strong> is from <strong>buon uomini</strong><em>, good people</em>. Even the <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratorio_dei_Buonomini_di_San_Martino"><strong>Wikipedia site</strong></a> is in Italian only.</p>
<h3>Churches:</h3>
<p>Some folks may only occasionally step into a church, but we advise you get your ass in there&#33; Entry is free &#40;coin boxes are plentiful&#41; and each has something to offer&#8211; the architecture, of course, and historical tie&#45;ins, and often at least a masterpiece or two. A mark of a good guidebook is that the highlights of the churches are covered. When accessible, the interior courtyards offer a bit of greenery. The masterpieces may have coin boxes nearby that trigger a few minutes of illumination, or maybe you’ll get lucky and encounter a tour group receiving a talk.</p> 
<p>David Byrne made the point that &#8220;Heaven, heaven is a place&hellip; where nothing, nothing ever happens.&#8221; Whereas depictions of hell, where bodies are regularly consumed in more ways than one and no human orifice is safe, provided an especially creative spark to many an artist’s imagination.</p>
<p>Grander churches have museums attached with entry fees, and these are Giny&#45;scale and generally terrific. I’ll highlight Santa Croce for over&#45;all grandness. On a more intimate scale, nothing compares with the Fra Angelico frescoes in the small individual monk&#39;s cells at San Marco. Still on my list to explore is Santa Maria Novella. </p>
<h3>A couple of walks:</h3>
<p>It is a fine walk up to Piazzale Michelangelo, on up to San Miniato al Monte, and downhill through a nice residential area. The stairway up to Piazzale Michelangelo starts at Piazza G. Poggi, located on the south side of the Arno exactly midway between the bridges Ponte Alle Grazie and Ponte S. Niccol&ograve;. You’ll naturally linger, enjoying the famous vista from the <strong>piazzale,</strong> <em>big piazza.</em>
 <strong>Che bella veduta!</strong> Then continue up the main street, viale Galileo, past one church to the next one, the richly decorated San Miniato al Monte. The church design, with a crypt below and the choir above is in a style pre&#45;dating the Renaissance called Tuscan Romanesque. Across the wide street viale Galileo and a bit down from the church, take the stepped section, called Via di San Salvatore al Monte, though maps may show only a few serpentine lines to depict it. You’ll find yourself heading downhill, back toward the river, on via del Monte alle Croce. I wonder if the cat houses &#40;small houses for real cats, that is&#41; are still in the fenced off wooded area&#63; As we approach the old wall, we stop for wine at the enoteca <strong>Fuori Porta</strong>, <em>Outside the Wall</em>, at via del Monte alle Croce 10r.</p>
 <p>We take the &#35;7 city bus up the hill to Fiesole. The steep&#45;ish street nearby affords one of the famous views of Florence. We dawdle, and have visited artisan shops and once hit a great market day. I led us on a walk back down via Vecchia Fiesolana. I was thinking I had got us lost &#40;again&#41;, especially when some other walkers turned right, and I convinced myself we should head left. We all came onto the same street below. We walked to the church San Domenico, then caught the bus from there into town.</p>
<h3>Some short recommendations:</h3>
<p>Giny recommends Ponte Vecchio at set&#45;up time&#8211; 0900.</p>
<p><strong>I Due Fratellini,</strong> <em>the two little borthers,</em> via del Cimatori 38&#47;r, for wine and panini. If you always wanted to drink some wine on a Florence sidewalk, action all around you, and have a numbered slot where you can set your wine glass, you’re there&#33; </p>
<p>Pitti Palace <em>Costume Museum, </em><a href="http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/english/musei/costume/Default.asp?"><strong>Galeria del Costume</strong></a>. Giny learned about the <strong>tutta</strong>, a one piece overall type of clothing that suited the visionary Italian Futurist era. And did you know that the Italians originated bluejeans? Yep, that&#8217; from <strong>blu de Genova.</strong> </p><p><a href="http://www.italian.it/santamarianovella/smnuk.htm"><strong>Officina Profumo&#45;Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella</strong></a>, the <em>Office of the perfumery&#45;pharmaceutical of Santa Maria Novella</em> &#40;but you knew that&#41; near the train station at via della Scala 16.  It is a store for their soaps, perfumes, candles and elixirs, it’s free, with great spaces and a glimpse into the Santa Maria Novella courtyard. A perfumery with style and history.</p>
<p><strong>Il magazzino La Rinascente</strong>, <em>the department store The Renaissance,</em>  at Piazza della Repubblica 1, has an eating area and veranda overlooking the piazza off its 4th floor. </p>
<h3>Fine places, especially for art history types:</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wga.hu/database/churches/brancacc.html"><strong>Capella Brancacci,</strong></a><em> Brancacci Chapel</em>, in Santa Maria del Carmine church on the south side of the Arno at Piazza del Carmine, features a frescoed story cycle begun by Masolino and  Masaccio and completed much later by Filippino Lippi. It is Masaccio’s talent and story that is central, and that, for painters, heralds the arrival of the Renaissance. At 22, he began the project as the older Masolino’s assistant. Masaccio’s flesh and blood portrayals outshone Masolino and inspired, among others, Michelangelo. His Adam and Eve expelled from the garden is, in my book, not so realistic, but achieves on another level, a timeless heightened expressiveness. Masaccio died three years later.</p>
               
<p>Visiting <strong>Cenacoli</strong>, <em>dining rooms, refectories</em>, <strong>&#40;cena </strong> means <em>dinner</em>&#41;. These are the old dining rooms connected to the living quarters at various church complexes. They feature a central painting, often a well&#45;done version of the Last Supper, and usually include additional displays. An art history student might go off the beaten path and record outstanding work by tracking down these interesting spaces during their limited open hours. There is a listing at the <a href="http://www.firenzeturismo.it/en/recensioni-firenze/cenacles-a-path-renaissance.html">Florence tourism APT site</a> and a listing is included on the <a href="http://www.museumsinflorence.com/landscapes/musei_firenze.html">Museums and Monuments of Florence</a> page, where linking to each cenacolo &#40;confusingly listed as Last Supper of...&#41; will provide hours.</p>
<p>When we visited the <a href="http://www.palazzo-medici.it/eng/home.htm"><strong>Palazzo Medici&#45;Riccardi</strong></a>, via Cavour 3, there was, on the entry level, an interactive screen display of Benozzo Gozzoli’s &#40;cool name&#8211; 4 z&#39;s&#41; painting in the palazzo’s chapel. Dialing in a language and standing under a metal umbrella, one could point at various parts of the screen and hear the story of the individual depicted or something more about the painting. It didn’t work perfectly, could only serve a few people at a time, and was rather comical when folks kept pointing, then pointing harder, to get it to work, but I cite it here for exhibit designers. </p>
<p>Not only does the <a href="http://www.museoferragamo.it/en/index.php"><strong>Salvatore Ferragamo store</strong></a>, via Tornabuoni, 2, feature our favorite window displays, but we enjoyed a special exhibit on color in shoes at the store&#8217;s shoe museum. We sprang for it and enjoyed not only the show but the inspiring rags to riches life history of Salvatore himself. Call it modern shoe history, with plenty of celebrity stories along the way.</p>
<h3>Daily needs and wants:</h3>
<p>There aren’t a lot of public toilets in Florence. Take advantage of museum stops&#33; Bars are required to provide bathrooms, so our basic strategy is to stop for a <strong>caff&egrave;</strong> &#40;espresso&#41; as needed. Or maybe, for my afternoon to be complete, a <strong>caff&egrave; corretto</strong>, <em>corrected coffee</em>, which is a regular <strong>caff&egrave;</strong> with a shot of brandy, grappa, Cynar, or other spirit. Great idea, amici&#33;</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.firenzeturismo.it/images/stories/informazioni-turistiche/altre_informazioni_utili/bagni_pubblici/firenze_wc.pdf">list of public toilets</a>&#8211; have coins available. Besides the address, they are listed by <em>area</em>, given as the nearest famous site.</p>
<p>Before you get on the train, you must <em>validate</em> your tickets at a yellow <strong>convalidare</strong> machine, found on each platform. When boarding a city bus, <strong>convalidare</strong> machines are on the bus aisle. </p>
<p>Say you&#8217;re moving through a crowd and you want to express <em>Excuse me</em>. Say <strong>Permesso</strong>. A likely choice for English speakers is the formal and polite <strong>Scusi</strong>, but it is a tad serious and also demanding, apropriate should you truly inconvenience someone or if you&#8217;re be late for an appointment.</p> 
<p>A simple and gracious utterance in numerous situations is <strong>Prego</strong>&#59; literally, <em>I pray.</em> Say it often, in situations like <em>please, you first, of course, no problem, etc.</em></p>
<p>In a restaurant, ask the waiter <strong>Che ci &#40;mi&#41; consiglia?&#59;</strong><em> What, to us &#40;to me&#41; do you recommend?</em>
 </p>
<p>To ask <em>What is your favorite, </em>say <strong>Che &egrave; il suo preferito</strong>? Don’t use the false friend <strong>favorito</strong>, which means something like <em>favored</em> in the sense of <em>advantaged</em>.</p>
<h3>Useful…</h3>
<p>An etto, 1&#47;10th of a <strong>chilo, </strong><em>kilo</em>, about a quarter of a pound, is the basic unit of measure in the marketplace. Read more on my short <em><a href="useful_italian/counting_numbers.pdf" title="link to the pdf">Useful Italian: Numbers and Counting</a> and the Marketplace pdf</em>.</p>
<p>While the smaller shops offer variety and charm, you’ll want to locate your nearest <strong>supermercato</strong>, which may exist behind an unremarkable entry. In Italian you’d ask, &#8220;Dov’&egrave; il supermercato pi&ugrave; vicino&#63;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong>, pronounced <em>bee&#45;oh</em>, means <em>organic</em>.</p>
<p>When asking for an address, it’s useful to write it down, then have it confirmed &#40;or corrected&#41;.</p>
<p>Use the 24 hour clock to express time, especially for transportation and hotels and the like.</p>
<p>The American month&#47;day&#47;year sequence for dates is, in Italy, day&#47;month&#47;year&#58; 28&#47;2&#47;11 &#61; February 28th, 2011.</p>
<p>When writing numbers, Italians use a period where we use a comma.</p>
<p>20&deg; is a mild 68, 25&deg; is a pleasant 77, 30&deg; is 86, 35&deg; is 95—<strong>fa caldo</strong>, <em>It’s hot.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, under a <strong>via, </strong><em>street,</em> name, you’ll see <strong>già</strong> followed by another name. This is the street’s  former name. </p>
<p>The country is organized as follows&#58; <strong>Regione</strong> &#40;pl. <strong>regioni,</strong> 20 in number&#41; &gt; <strong>Provincia</strong> &#40;pl. <strong>provincie</strong>&#8211; 110&#41; &gt; <strong>Comune</strong> &#40;pl.<strong>Comuni</strong>&#41; &gt; <strong>Città</strong>. I think that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Gli Stati Uniti</strong>, the <em>United States,</em> may fly the <em>red, white and blue.</em> The Italians honor their <strong>verde, bianco e rosso, </strong><em>green, white and red.</em></p>
<p><strong>Non calpestare l&#8217;erba</strong> means <em>Don&#8217;t walk on the grass</em>. You may see <strong>non calpestare l’aiuole</strong>, <em>Don’t walk on the flowerbeds</em>. This is only to observe that <strong>aiuole </strong>has all five verbs and only one consonant&#33; Other favorite words&#58; <strong>cucchiaino</strong>, <em>teaspoon</em>&#59; <strong>dopo domani</strong>, <em>day after tomorrow</em>.</p>
<h3>A few trips out of town</h3>
<p>Check train routes carefully&#8212;some are quicker than others.</p>
<p>Florence and Tuscany bus and train schedules can be viewed and planned on the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=43.46,11.05&spn=3.55,5.84&dirflg=r" title="An interactive listing of regional train and bus services for Florence."><strong><em>Toscana</em> Google Transit</strong></a> site.</p>
<p>Lucca&#33; Bikes can be rented and the ride atop the city walls, with views into the town and out to the countryside, is what John calls &#8220;The greatest flat bike ride in the world.&#8221; One can ride around town, too, and experience Pisan architecture &#40;rising rows of exterior columns&#41;, classy shops, and a pleasant town. Really seeing the compact old town, all within the city walls, might be more enjoyable without a bike, as ours didn&#8217;t come with a lock and we felt a need to keep an eye on them. By train from Florence, it is less than 1&#45;1&#47;2 hours each way and about 12&#8364; round trip. </p>
<p>Prato&#33;  The <em>textile museum</em>, <a href="http://www.museodeltessuto.it/front-page-en?set_language=en"><strong>Museo del Tessuto</strong></a>, showcases a history of textiles and Prato&#8217;s still&#45;important place as a center for innovative textile design. The Swabian castle is a shell, but may interest the historians for its ties to Frederick II&#8212;<strong>stupor mundi &#40;Latin&#41;&#8212;</strong><em>the wonder of the world</em>, whose roots were the Hohenstaufen, the Ghibelline side of the classic pre&#45;and&#45;early Renaissance Florence battle between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. Prato, proudly home to actor&#47;writer&#47;director Roberto Benigni, is famous for its <em>cookies</em>, <strong>cantucci</strong>, and the most famous cookie&#45;maker, Biscottificio Antonil Mattei, is at via Ricasoli 20. I like the <strong>brutta ma buoni</strong>, <em>ugly but good</em>. Some train routes take only 20 minutes from Florence, about 2&#8364; each way.</p>
<p>Into Chianti&#33; We went to Panzano&#45;in&#45;Chianti to visit the <a href="http://www.dariocecchini.com/index_eng.html"><strong>Macelleria</strong></a>,<em>butcher shop,</em>of <strong>Dario Cecchini.</strong> I had read about him in <em>Saveur</em>, and Ian knew him from <em>The Food Network</em> as Italy&#8217;s most famous butcher. I must say, once we were there, I was at a bit of a loss of what to do next except to look around the butcher shop. Fortunately, lunch is served on the veranda &#40;12&#45;3, closed Sundays&#41;, so our next step was clear. There are two menu items, the Mac Dario &#40;burger &amp; fries&#41; for 10&#8364; and the big hit with us, the <strong>Accoglienza</strong>, <em>Welcome, </em>for 20. He also has evening restaurants that don’t work well with the bus schedule. </p>
<p>The larger point is that it is easy to catch a bus into the heart of Chianti. The same <a href="http://www.acvbus.it/orari/365.pdf"><strong>line from Florence that ends in Panzano</strong></a> stops along the way in other towns you’ll know from your wine labels. The ACV bus site offers a nice map at <strong>Menu principale &gt; </strong><a href="http://www.acvbus.it/index.php?SEZ=5"><strong>grafo delle linee</strong></a>. To get the schedule for other lines, use the <a href="http://www.acvbus.it/">ACV bus site</a>, choose <strong>Menu principale &gt; Elenco linee&#45;orari</strong>, <em>line and time directory</em>, and click the various lines to get the bus schedules, both from and back to Florence &#40;on my screen, the numerals and word descriptions don’t line up&#41;. </p>
<h3>Dinner &amp; drinks&#58;</h3>
<p>The full dinner order is: <strong>antipasto</strong>, then <strong>primo</strong> &#40;pasta dish&#41;, then <strong>secondo</strong> &#40;meat or fish&#8211; main dish&#41; usually with <strong>contorni</strong>, <em>surrounding stuff,</em> some vegetable or beans or such on the side, then the <strong>insalata</strong>, <em>salad, </em>and maybe some <em>cheese</em>, <strong>formaggio</strong>, or a <strong>dolce</strong><em>, sweet.</em></p>
<p>These full-blown meals seem to be for Sunday dinners and special occasions. Simply order as you wish. Your waiters may well know English and be quite helpful. Giny and I sometimes share a primo and a secondo, though I always ask, saying, <strong>&Egrave; possibile di condividere</strong><em>, Is it possible to share?</em> Or <strong>Potremmo condividere?</strong><em>Would we be able to share&#63; </em>They often make up single portions into two plates for us, graciousness being quite their style, perhaps through gritted teeth, but I haven’t noticed.</p>
<p>The drink order is&#58; <strong>aperitivo</strong> before dinner, <strong>vino</strong> with some <strong>agua</strong> &#40;<strong>con gas/frizzante</strong>, <em>fizzy</em>, or no&#41; and they look at you funny if you don’t follow up with a <strong>caff&egrave;</strong>. I’ve heard of a <strong>caff&egrave; amazzatta</strong>, <em>kill the coffee</em>, which is brandy in your still&#45;warm cup, though I’ve never seen anyone have this &#40;except me, at home&#41;. There may well be a <strong>digestivo</strong>, a brandy or grappa. Other <strong>digestivi</strong> are herbal concoctions, always a secret &#40;and alcoholic&#41; formula. </p><p>Some places have a bit of a spread of small bites around aperitivo time to accompany your drink order, or at least a small bowl of olives or cheese snacks or nuts.</p>
<h2>Santo Spirito</h2>
<p>This section is about Santo Spirito, our favorite piazza and <strong>quartiere</strong>, <em>neighborhood,</em> the place we think of as our &#8220;home&#8221; in Florence. Reading about Florence, you’ll read about Oltrarno, the area across the Arno from the historic center. Oltrarno is sometimes referred to as a neighborhood or a quarter, quarter being a translation of <strong>quartiere</strong>, <em>neighborhood.</em> I think of Oltrarno as an area or general district, made up of a number of several individual <strong>quartieri</strong>.</p>
<p>Back to Santo Spirito&#58; Weekdays start with produce booths arranged around the center and household goods and clothes sold from booths at the south end. Church bells announce a service at Santo Spirito church. </p>
<p>There’s an &#8220;Antiquarian Market&#8221; one weekend per month, and an &#8220;Herbs and Tools Market&#8221; another&#8211; most likely the 2nd &amp; 3rd Sunday of each month, but not in August. I’m not clear about the winter months.</p>
<p>We remember one day when the home goods market was set up as usual, a television soap was being filmed in another corner, and a student demonstration filled the church porch and steps&#33; </p>
<p>From the south end of the piazza &#40;the end opposite the church&#41; head east &#40;walking away from the church, turn right&#41; on Via Sant&#8217;Agostino  to the bakery, Il Forno, the Ortofruttolo &#40;vegetable and fruit store&#41; and a number of other shops. My Illini&#47;Parisienne niece Lucie &#40;her award&#45;winning food blog is <a href="http://bilingualbutter.blogspot.com/" title="link to Bilingual Butter">Bilingual Butter</a>&#41) remembers the Asian store. One comes to the cross street Via Serragli, and my favorite pizzicheria&#8211; a sliced meat and cheese store. Back to heading east on Via Sant&#8217;Agostino, its name changes to Via San Monaca, and, traveling on this a bit, there&#8217;s a supermercato on the right.</p>
<h3>If you have time for a visit to Santo Spirito&#58;</h3>
<p>Bar Ricchi serves a well&#45;regarded cappuccino and good gelato. Giny read that <a href="http://www.faithwillinger.com/"><strong>Faith Willinger</strong></a>,  known for her books including <em>Eating in Italy</em> and for her cooking classes, is a regular here. In <em>The Monster of Florence</em>,  Douglas Preston&#8217;s real&#45;life investigation and adventure begins at Bar Ricchi. The interior eating area is adorned with fantasized images for the unadorned front of Santo Spirito church, images inspired by local resident and artist <a href="http://www.fictionalcities.co.uk/florencespirito.htm"><strong>Mario Mariotti&#8217;s 1980 art project</strong></a> consisting of amazing projections onto the church&#8217;s facade.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s more like lunchtime, grab a panino at Bar Ricchi or at Gustapanino, via dei Michelozzi 13&#47;r, or shop for a picnic along Via Serragli and come back to the piazza, where the likely vantage point is the steps in front of the church. There are also a couple of benches and the fountain. Casalinga, at Via Michelozzi 9&#47;r, makes it into many guidebooks as a reasonably priced trattoria. I like it best at lunchtime&#8211; it&#8217;s just off the piazza heading west from the front corner of the church.</p
><p>Cabiria Caf&eacute; opens up for lunch, and is a favorite pre&#45;dinner aperitivo spot. For dinner, Borgo Antico is humming, and the other restaurants try to match the buzz. The Popcaf&eacute; pops out late at night. At night and until the wee hours, the church steps are a popular, sometimes raucous, hangout.</p>
<p>Santo Spirito church, dome&#45;builder Brunelleschi&#8217;s last design and completed after his death, is open most days. The <a href="http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/museum_of_santo_spirito.html">Santo Spirito church</a> has a <strong>cenacolo</strong><em>, dining room,</em> with  a varied but interesting display and, on the wall, an Orcagna fresco. I wish I could be clear on when the <strong>Cenacolo</strong> is open, perhaps only on Saturdays. The cenacolo&#39;s <strong> &#8220;Fondazione Romano&#8221;</strong> collection of 11th century sculptures and fragments is often described as haphazard&#59; I love these kind of peculiar groupings, the collected work has heart and often reflects pre&#45;Renaissance times. </p>
<p>On the piazza&#8217;s southeast corner is a palazzo featuring an upstairs porch, a loggia. Earlier house forms required a defensive front, but this was built at a time of changing needs and styles, and was a prime example of what would become a common feature throughout Europe.</p>
<p>You may spot a low&#45;relief sculpture on the east side of the piazza commemorating the site of the killing of  WWII partisans. </p>
<p>A famous woodworking shop, Bini, closed in 2008 after more than a century of making wooden hat forms for hatmakers and sculptures of everyday objects that were sold in galleries around Europe. I recently read that some of Bini&#8217;s work is preserved in a new spot&#8211; a &#8220;museum&#45;bookstore&#45;caf&eacute; named Volume &#40;vo&#45;LOO&#45;meh&#41;. I&#8217;d love to hear about it.</p>

<h3>More on Oltrarno</h3>
<p>Oltrarno comprises five neighborhoods along the south bank of the Arno. Arrayed west to east, these are Pignone, San Frediano, Santo Spirito, Pitti, and San Niccol&ograve;.</p>

<p>From the <strong>Comune di Firenze</strong>, <em>Council of Florence,</em> website, here&#8217;s a map that accurately reflects the neighborhoods of Oltrarno. This site calls the area <a href="http://www.diladdarno.it/map-section.asp?sez=sogaffit&p=room"><strong>Diladdarno</strong></a>, which translates as something like &#8220;That part across the Arno over there.&#8221; Info on the Diladdarno site is spotty and not kept up&#45;to&#45;date.<a href="http://www.diladdarno.it/map-section.asp?sez=mobparch&p=parking"><em> Sites for parking</em></a> may be helpful.</p>

<p>It looks like the <a href="http://www.florencewinevent.com/index.html?Pagina=/news/primapagina.asp?idLingua=1&PrimaPagina=X&idSito=1"><em>Florence Wine Event</em></a> will happen in 2010 on November 19, 20, and 21. We attended a few years ago and give it 11 stars. Our experience was of wine stops at three Oltrarno piazzas, our itinerary of choice ending at Piazza Santo Spirito, where there were 200 chairs set up for a big dinner.  The map for the 2009 event had wine booths set up in six <strong>piazze</strong>, even better&#33; </p><p> The later date in 2010 means dicier weather, and so it will be centrally located in the <strong><a href="http://www.firenzealbergo.it/EN/Experience-Florence/sport-wellness/pages/Cortile_dell_Ammannati-.aspx" title="Writing and a photo about the cortile">Cortile dell'Ammannati</a></strong>, the interior courtyard of <strong>Palazzo Pitti</strong>, <em>Pitti Palace</em>. The central and partially covered location means everything will go on in the event of <strong>maltempo</strong>, <em>bad weather</em>. Another big bonus&#8212;the Boboli gardens are right there, though I don't know if you'll be able to wander through the gardens with your wine in hand &#40;or in your wine-bib&#41;. Still sounds great, though wandering from piazza to piazza, wine in hand, was one of those &#8220;Life gets no better&#8221; moments. </p>

<p>A sidetrack here to highlight another Florence wine event, <em><a href="http://www.winetownfirenze.com/viewContent.aspx?Id=8" title="link to the English version of the WineTownFirenze 2010 site.">WineTownFirenze 2010</a></em>, which took place for the first time September 30th through October 3rd. This ranged across the historic center and also into Oltrarno. It was an international showing of wines and numerous talks and programs. The <a href="http://www.winetownfirenze.com/default2.aspx" title="Link to the WineTownFirenze Italian home page">Italian home page for the event</a> features a map, wacky but fun videos, and a picture of smart and sassy young folks. Their outfits would be ruined by the blue bib-type things we'ver worn at other wine events. The bibs have a slit into which one slides the glass, and it's held there, leaving hands free for eating and gesticulating. I didn't attend in 2010, and in looking up information about how it went I encountered a comment congratulating the organizers on turning Wednesday's confusion into a fine weekend. I did turn up a couple of <a href="http://anthonyheraadventures.blogspot.com/2010/10/experiencing-first-wine-town-firenze.html" title="links to a blog about Wine Town Firenze 2010.">blog posts by Anthony and Hera</a>, two travelers from Canada recording their Firenze experiences, but no additional reviews. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.firenze-oltrarno.net/"><strong>Firenze&#45;Oltrarno </strong></a>is a site with good intentions but not kept up. It does have snippets of information about the neighborhood. There is a map with locations of the <a href="http://www.firenze-oltrarno.net/english/arte/spirito.php"><strong>neighborhood tabernacles</strong></a>, seen along the streets. These would make an interesting and fun study for an art history person.</p>

<p>Walking along the river to Piazza G. Poggi puts one at the base of the steps up to the grand Piazzale Michelangelo.</p>

<p>Oltrarno is the antiques center of Florence and the home of numerous workshops of all sorts. There are schools where art and craft techniques are taught. The neighborhoods are active with artisans and exhibits. Special events are held to promote and sustain them. This can be seen in the Dialddarno and Firenze&#45;Oltrarno sites mentioned above. If artisans are of special interest to you, you may also be interested in this website devoted to <a href="http://www.collezionitoscane.info/en/home.html"><strong>crafts in the entire region of Tuscany</strong></a>.</p>

<p>After a few years of work, <a href="http://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&amp;sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bardinipeyron.it%2Fab"><strong>Villa Bardini</strong></a> has its exhibits and garden open.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.museocasasiviero.it/ww4_siviero/rodolfosiviero.page?country=ENG"><strong>free museum in the house where lived Rodolfo Siviero</strong></a>, who tracked and then recovered Italian art looted during World War II. His website says it so well, &#8220;His sometimes rather unscrupulous way of doing things and his great success with the opposite sex earned him the reputation as the James Bond of the art world.&#8221; The collection of furniture is intriguing, and the art and art fragments are interesting for their variety and for being this expert&#8217;s personal favorites. It is on the corner of Piazza Poggi and Lungarno Serristori in San Niccol&ograve;.</p>

<p>Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning lived at Piazza San Felice 8, near the Pitti Palace, in <a href="http://www.browninglibrary.org/index.php?id=45915"><strong>Casa Guidi</strong></a>, today a museum. Elizabeth is buried in Florence in the <a href="http://www.cultura.toscana.it/architetture/giardini/firenze/cimitero_inglesi.shtml"><strong>Cimitero degli Inglesi</strong></a>, <em>Cemetery of the English</em>, the Protestant cemetery. Some of her work was published by <a href="http://www.giuliogiannini.it/"><strong>Giulio Giannini e Figlio</strong></a>, a printing and binding establishment &#40;today more shop than trade&#41; still in the family on Piazza Pitti.</p>
<p>Elizabeth seems beloved, Robert isn’t much mentioned. Moving to Italy was literally a life saver for Elizabeth, though she died at Casa Guidi. Outside of Casa Guidi, at the corner of via Mazzetta and via Maggio, is an installed stone plaque written by Niccol&ograve; Tommaseo. Translated, it would read, &#8220;Here wrote and died Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who in the heart of a woman reconciled erudite knowledge and the spirit of a poet and made in her verse a golden ring between Italy and England. A grateful Florence placed this memorial, 1861.&#8221; There is another stone that has a bit of her verse about songs heard from the piazza through her window. I’m rattling on about this to share this information with my family, but the stone commemorative plaques throughout the city reveal a learned and local pride in the many writers and artists who worked in Florence.</p>
<h2>Planning Page&#8211; for Florence and nearby areas</h2>
<p>To maximize any short stay in Florence, consult the many fine guidebooks. I list some useful short guides and get you into the bus and train system in this section, then list some websites about Florence.</p>
<h3>General information&#58;</h3>
<p>My favorite hotel&#45;finding site, <a href="http://www.venere.com/"><strong>Venere</strong></a>, is good for all of Europe, or simply go to  <a href="http://www.venere.com/italy/florence/" title="A listing of hotels in Florence on the Venere website">Florence Hotels</a>. Many swear by <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels"><strong>Tripadvisor</strong>.</a></p><p>Subscribe to the <a href="http://www.pitcherflaccomio.com/new/index.php?file=nl"><em>Pitcher &amp; Flaccomio newsletter</em></a>, a monthly look at activities around Florence. You can print a back issue for the month you plan to be there, and some of the events&#8212;especially the festivals and fairs in or out of town&#8212;are likely to re&#45;occur when you visit. Then you can catch the current issue when your travel time arrives. Their site is also a guide to week&#45;or&#45;more rentals that they handle as well as properties for sale.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.museumsinflorence.com/landscapes/musei_firenze.html"><em>Museums and monuments of Florence</em></a>&#8212;print this page and you’ll have the Italian name with a full English listing&#8212;a checklist or inspiration for “what to do today.&#8221; Go to the home page for an alphabetical listing in English with links to monument pages. Their &#8220;Book Online&#8221; button didn&#8217;t work for me, and their map didn&#8217;t scale well.</p>
<h3> APT, the official tourism board of Florence</h3>
<p>Here is the English language version of <a href="http://www.firenzeturismo.it/"><strong>APT &#40;agenzia per il turismo Firenze&#41;</strong></a>, the official <em>Tourism Board of Florence</em>. The site was re-worked in mid&#45;2010 and does have the occasional dropped link and a number of un&#45;translated pages.</p><p>There is plenty under <em>Tourist Information</em> to look through, and don’t miss the vital information on the Tourist Information &gt; <a href="http://www.firenzeturismo.it/en/other-useful-information/"><strong>Other Useful Information</strong></a> page, including health services, public toilets, currency exchange, and more.</p><p>The<em> Events </em>page allows you to enter a range of dates and see all the listings for a given time&#8211; a comprehensive listing and great planning tool. <em>Art &amp; Museums </em>is useful for Florence and for all the greater area. If you’re staying outside of Florence, you can type in your nearby town and see what is going on around there. The <em>Explore Florence and its region</em> section gives referrals to the various outlying area&#8217;s own helpful sites. </p><p>The same site has a <a href="http://www.firenzeturismo.it/en/getting-around/in-bus.html">bus page</a>. I have a section upcoming where I cover city buses.</p><p>Launched along with the new version of the APT site is an all-new <a href="http://www.turismo.intoscana.it/intoscana2/export/TurismoRTen/"><strong>Regione Toscana</strong></a>, <em>Tuscan Region,</em> website.</p>
<h3>Regional transportation&#8212the future is here</h3>
<p>In 2008, Google announced that Italy would be the first country, and Florence and Turin the first cities, to have transit systems serviced by Google Transit. In their <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/transit/text.html#eu" title="A listing on Google of all places served by Google transit">general worldwide listing</a>, the greater Florence area is served as <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=43.46,11.05&spn=3.55,5.84&dirflg=r" title="An interactive listing of regional train and bus services for Florence."><strong>Toscana</strong></a>, <em>Tuscany</em>. Using this service, you can plan a trip using public transportation.</p>
<h3>City buses&#58;</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ataf.net/en/ataf.aspx?idC=2&LN=en-US"><strong>ATAF</strong></a> is the local Florence bus service. You can enter addresses or famous sights and find the bus you need. ATAF opened a new <a href="http://www.ataf.net/System/files/sala-clienti_where.jpg" title="map with the new ATAF customer center"><strong>sala clienti</strong></a>, <em>customer room</em>, in the Santa Maria Novella train station in August, 2010. The link shows not only the location of the room, but all the bus stops with bus numbers surrounding the station. Provided here is a <a href="useful_italian/ataf_sala_clienti_prnt_rd.pdf" title="map showing the customer room and surrounding bus stops at the Santa Maria Novella train station">better&#45;printing version of the same map</a>.</p>
<p>We buy packets of individual tickets for sharing with visitors or friends, and the re&#45;usable Carta Agile tickets for our regular use. Bus tickets and passes are available at all tabacchi, some bars, and the bus stop outside the train station. Be sure to validate your ticket upon entering the bus&#8212;look for a machine along the aisle.</p><p>There is, sad to say, no map of the all the routes on the ATAF site. If you’re in Florence for a while, buy a map of bus routes at the train station.</p>
<p>A few favorite bus lines&#58; The 12 and 13 &#40;traveling right&#45;hand or left&#45;hand circular routes&#41; go uphill to the beautiful viewpoint Piazzale Michelangelo, up from which is the Tuscan Romanesque church San Miniato al Monte. There is a popular hostel along the line, too. The &#35;7 city bus takes you uphill, north, to Fiesole, a fine stop and more the Roman outpost than was Florence, which was hotter, swampier, and buggier. The &#35;10 Settignano bus takes you to within a moderate walk to the famous <a href="http://www.villagamberaia.it/home"><strong>Villa Gamberaia</strong></a> garden, available for public viewing. </p><p><a href="http://www.ataf.net/en/fares/tickets.aspx?idC=82&LN=en-US"><strong>ATAF city bus ticket fares</strong></a>&#58; Though 90-minutes basic fare may be listed, the standard is now 70 minutes.</p><p>The <strong>tramvia </strong>or <strong>linea tranviaria</strong>, <em>light rail, </em>is being built. The T1 Scandicci line is running, with more to come.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ataf.net/System/files/FOLDER%20VOLA%20IN%20BUS%202.pdf"><strong>volainbus</strong></a>, <em>&#8220;fly&#45;by&#45;bus,&#8221; </em>connects the Florence airport and the train station&#47;SITA bus area.</p><p>The Pisa International Airport is connected by <a href="http://www.pisa-airport.com/index.php?lang=_en&id_sect=221"><strong>train service</strong></a>. </p><p>There are two city sightseeing routes in Florence, lines A and B, available through <a href="http://www.city-sightseeing.com/index.phtml?command=search&clear-search=true&destinations=florence">CitySightseeing</a>. Their site is comprehensive. They offer sightseeing in other cities, too.</p>
<h3>Buses in the historic center&#8211; the C1/C2/C3/D lines&#58;</h3>
<div class="img1"><img  src="useful_italian/florence_bussini_150_720px.jpg" width="720" height="620" alt="historic enter bus routes for Florence, Italy" longdesc="useful_italian/florence_bussini_150_720px.jpg" /></div>
<p>These are the bus lines serving the historic center. Individual stops are shown. They run every 10 minutes. Also shown are the <strong>interscambio</strong>, <em>interchange</em>, lines for the various numbered lines that continue out of the center.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.ataf.net/en/ataf.aspx?idC=2&LN=en-US"><strong>ATAF site</strong></a>, to see individual lines on a scalable map, go to&#58; <em>plan your route</em>, select <em>lines</em>, then choose a line. At the individual line&#8217;s page, go to <em>Detailed route &gt; Show route on Travel Planner. </em>Click the magnifying glass for a scalable map of the line overlaid on the Florence area map. To see other lines, work your way back, or you can click <strong>cerca linee</strong>, <em>search lines</em>, and enter a line number, or use the menu bar at the top to go to <strong>orari e percorsi</strong>,</p>
<p>Through my own website I have made available a <a href="http://www.johnrose-glass.com/useful_italian/florence_bus_lines_rd.pdf"><strong>map of the full Florence bus system.</strong></a></p><p>One can download, but why would you want to, the complete bus brochure. If you care to see it, email me for the link. It is a 7 MB document, takes forever to download, and measures 19&#34; x 27&#34; &#40;48cm x 69cm&#41;. But if you’re like me and need to see every damn detail, I'll get it to you.</p>
<h3>Trains and regional buses&#58;</h3>
<p>The train service is <strong> <a href="http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ad1ce14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD" title="Link to the Trenitalia site">Trenitalia</a></strong>.</p>
<p> In the main Florence train station, Santa Maria Novella, are kiosks where one can choose English, then type and choose different destinations, going or returning, get a listing of train times, and purchase tickets. You can change your departure point as well, thus buying tickets ahead of time for departure from a different town. When you use these, make sure your baggage is protected and have your wallet in a safe situation so you can concentrate on the screen.</p> 
<p>Of course you can go to the ticket counter&#8212;the wise tip is to write down your destination and times and pass it to the attendant. Use the 24&#45;hour clock, not a.m and p.m. <strong>Andata solamente</strong> is <em>one way going</em>, <strong>andata e ritorno</strong> is <em>round trip</em>. It is not too difficult to understand the traditional <strong>Partenze</strong> and <strong>Arrivo</strong> sheets at the <em>platform</em>, <strong>binario</strong>&#8212;the bold print is the destination and in smaller print are the stops in between. Longer trips on the fancy Eurostar trains are reserved seating, but most other tickets are good any day within a 30&#45;day window, so changing plans doesn’t always mean needing new tickets.</p>
<p>The SITA regional bus station in Florence is at Via Santa Caterina da Siena 15r, just southwest of Santa Maria Novella train station. <strong>SITA</strong> serves areas beyond the city system. The buses pull into an interior bus&#45;loading area, so you might not spot it at first. You can buy tickets right there and ahead of time. For the best help, check in at the information office ahead of time.</p> 
<p>Here’s the general <a href="http://www.sitabus.it/wps/portal" title="a link to the main SITA home page">SITA site</a>.</p>
<p>At <em><strong>Scegli la regione</strong> &#40;choose the region&#41;</em> go to <strong><em>Toscana</em></strong> &#40;or perhaps you want to go to another region&#41;.</p>
<p>A common SITA trip from Florence is to Siena. The express service is faster than the direct service. The Siena bus takes you right into Siena. Take it to the final stop, Piazza Gramsci. Siena&#8217;s train station is 2 km outside of town, connected to town by buses that run regularly. Myself and others have found the station and transitions confusing.</p>
<p>There are other companies that serve other outlying areas. The <a href="http://www.lazzi.it/itanew/activenews.asp" title="link to the bus line Lazzi">Lazzi line</a> is a consortium of smaller bus lines. The &#8220;English&#8221; button didn't work for me. Not listed on the Lazzi site is <a href="http://www.autolineetoscane.it/orari.htm" title="link to the autolinee toscane bus site">Autolinee Toscane</a>.</p>

<h3>Sites about Florence&#58;</h3>
<p>Visit the site for the <a href="http://en.comune.fi.it/"><strong>Comune di Firenze</strong></a>, which I think of as both the greater <em>city of Florence</em> and the governmental structure <em> Council of Florence</em>. Highly recommended is the Information for Tourists</em> section. Also available is information about traffic and parking. You can look up Citizens rights&#33; This is the city&#8217;s site, about recent developments, its government, organization and services, and some upcoming events. </p>
<p>Wherever you&#39;re going in  Italy, there may be a site for any locality. Simply enter <em>Comune di&hellip;&#40;enter name of town&#41;.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theflorentine.net/"><em>The Florentine</em></a> is an English language bi&#45;weekly with articles and up&#45;to&#45;date information about various events in and around Florence. I understand it is available in schools and places where a mass of English speakers are together. I made a few attempts to find an issue on my last trip, but was not successful. I have become aware of the website as I worked on these notes. Under <em>Events</em>, they offer a good list of activities in and around Florence. The site doesn’t try to separate the in&#45;town and around&#45;the&#45;greater&#45;area events and so, without some recognition of places in the area, you may need a map to identify locations. The individual links accompanying the event listings are a help. I enjoyed looking through the classifieds. The rest of the site is an extensive compilation of past articles organized into categories. </p>
<p>While I haven’t used it, this <a href="http://www.dininginflorence.com/"><em>Dining in Florence</em></a> site looks like an extensive listing of food spots. It seems like a Travelocity model, inviting comments,  but with little public participation. Its mapping of locations is good, and you can look by area.</p>
<p>I like the spirit and succinctness of the articles at this site, <a href="http://www.florencefromtheheart.com/"><em>Florence from the Heart,</em></a> another one I came across recently. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting and promising site, Mappery, composed of maps, all kinds of maps. At this page of a <a href="http://mappery.com/map-of/Florence-Tourist-Map"><strong>Florence map,</strong></a> see other choices on the top right, and click <em>see more</em> to do just that. </p>
<p>This is another site, <a href="http://www.florence-on-line.com/"><em>Florence on line</em></a>, with the Tripadvisor model in mind, but with scant participation. When I was seeking a map of the city bus system, an inquiry here brought a quick, helpful response. <em>Florence on line</em> announced an affiliation with rental site Venere in late 2010.</p>
<p>Here’s a similarly named but unrelated site that I haven’t explored, <a href="http://en.firenze-online.com/"><em>Firenze online</em></a>. I was so charmed by the sincerity of this excerpt that I conclude this planning section with it. On the site, the writer follows up this paragraph with mention of the opportunities to learn and appreciate these skills even today&#58; </p>
<p>&#8220;Without doubt when we plan a travel to Florence we make it first of all in order to admire its beauties, its monuments and in order to breathe an atmosphere that seems is stopped in the time. But many tourists reach Florence in order to learn the limbs that characterize Florence and the Tuscany for hundred of years. In the time artisan, generation after generation, have realized many work&#58; gold work, ceramics work, painting work, design work, sculpture work. Florence is also this an open museum with realizate works of art from the greatest artists, sculpture, painters and Fiorentini craftsmen.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Best Cappuccino</h2>
<p>Just for fun and to encourage purposeful wayfinding in Firenze,following is a list from the<em> Pitcher &amp; Flaccomio Newsletter</em>, April, 2007&#8211 best cappuccino in Florence&#33; While it&#8217;s been a few years since the list was compiled, I’ll bet the cappuccino is still great. A strong aural memory is the clatter of the<strong> servizio da caff&egrave;</strong> on the stone counters. 
</p>
<p>Budino di Riso is mentioned a couple of times. These are small rice pastries made with Arborio rice, the same as used to make risotto. My morning search, probably instigated by Mara, was for the ideal <strong>cornetto crema</strong>, the Italian <em>cream&#45;filled croissant.</em></p>

	<h2> Italian radio and poscasts</h2>
    <p>I began listening to Italian radio on the computer some years ago. To make audio files, I used <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/" title="the link to rogue amoeba, makers of Audio Hijack Pro"><em>Audio Hijack Pro</em></a> from the company <em>rogue amoeba</em> to record the audio. I learned a lot, and still do, by listening to shows repeated times.</p>
   <p>Now, plenty of good radio can be had on iTunes or at a station&#39;s website. A few shows I subscribe to are <em> English 24</em>, <em>Gastronauta</em>, and <em>Decanter</em>.</p>
  <p>My favorite learning show is <em><a href="http://www.radio24.ilsole24ore.com/main.php?dirprog=English%2024" title="The Radio 24 website for the show English 24">English 24</a></em>, <strong>English ventiquattro</strong>. They will play comments or a short speech by an American or Brit, usually a political figure or someone from the arts world, and then, section by section, render the phrases in Italian, with quick explanations of literal translations followed by freer but better translation of the English. My thanks to Marta Cagnola and Giulia Cravelli for a fine show.</p>
  <p>I had to try <a href="http://www.radio24.ilsole24ore.com/main.php?dirprog=Il%20Gastronauta" title="link to the Radio 24 show Gastronauta">Gastronauta</a> just for the witty name, implying explorations to the nether reaches of gastronomy. In fact, the show talks mostly about the finer points of food and wine Italians know well, with guests and interviews. </p>
 <p> Both of these shows are on <a href="http://www.radio24.ilsole24ore.com/index.php" title="home page for Radio 24">Radio 24</a>. A full listing of their shows at their site is listed at their site under <strong>programmi</strong>, or you can go to their <a href="http://www.radio24.ilsole24ore.com/listaprog.php?podcast=1" title="Radio 24 link to their podcasts">podcast listings</a> for additional shows or to subscribe.</p>
 <p>Decanter is another <strong>enogastronomia</strong> show whose site offers links to just a few recipes and other related items.  <a href="http://www.decanter.rai.it/dl/Radio2/sito/PublishingBlock-fc504c09-c9c7-4d61-895f-c4803b127722.html" title="link to the enogastonomia show Decanter">Decanter</a> is on <em> <a href="http://www.radio2.rai.it/dl/Radio2/Page-c933903c-a350-485c-acc0-ec1eb16b245d.html" title="link to the Italian radio station Radio Due">RAI 2 or Radio 2</a></em>, <strong>Rai 2 o Radio Due</strong>, just one of the stations that is part of the multimidia organization <a href="http://www.rai.it/" title="homepage for the Italian multimedia network RAI">RAI</a>, <strong>Radiotelevisione Italiana</strong>. These stations seem to be a very rough equivalent of National Public Radio in the U.S., but more commercial, and I have heard that Berluschoni somehow controls RAI, but it doesn't seem like a mouthpiece for his views. </p>
 <p><strong><a href="http://www.radio2.rai.it/dl/Radio2/Page-c933903c-a350-485c-acc0-ec1eb16b245d.html" title="link to the website for Radio due">Radio Due</a></strong> has a number of fine shows, and their <a href="http://www.radio2.rai.it/dl/Radio2/podcast.html" title="list of podcasts from Radio Due">podcast file</a> links you right up with iTunes. Not available as podcasts is a rich array of narrated books and specially written shows from their show <a href="http://www.rai.it/dl/Radio2/alleottodellasera.html#anchorListaPuntate" title="Radio due link to the archives their show Alle Otto della Sera"><strong>Alle Otto della Sera</strong></a><em>, At Eight in the Evening</em>. The focus is on history and historical figures. I don't see any way to download the shows unless you play them and use your own software to preserve the files. The show's <strong>archivio</strong>, <em>archive</em>, of past shows is extensive.</p>
 <p>Another rich archive of spoken-word programs can be found on RAI 3, the RAI channel to go to for classical music. The <strong><a href="http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/terzo_anello/index.cfm" title="A list of programs available for listening at RAI 3">Il Terzo Anello programmi</a></strong> site will give you plenty to choose from. There are 30-minute commentaries on each Italian province on <strong><em><a href="http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/elenco.cfm?Q_PROG_ID=547#" title="link to the radio broadcast about the Italian provinces"> Mosaico Italiano</a></em></strong>.
 Perhaps I've saved the best till last, and that is the RAI 3 Terzo Anello program <strong><em><a href="http://www.radio3.rai.it/dl/radio3/programmi/PublishingBlock-6f050596-ec16-4a4a-9f0c-be190ad4c491.html" title="home page for Ad Alta Voce, where one can listen to novels read in Italian">Ad Alta Voce</a></em></strong>. Here whole novels are read. Maybe you'd like to hear such Italian classics as  <strong><em><a href="http://www.radio3.rai.it/dl/radio3/programmi/PublishingBlock-25f54791-c748-45e6-a372-cc2940095c2d.html" title="link to the reading of the italian novel "The Leopard"">Il Gattopardo</a></em></strong>, <em>The Leopard</em>, or Natalia Ginzburg's intimate <strong><em><a href="http://www.radio3.rai.it/dl/radio3/programmi/PublishingBlock-24b758c8-152b-4c68-a238-63383b856477.html" title="Link to the reading of Lessico Famigliare">Lessico Famigliare</a></em></strong>, published in English as both <em>Family Sayings</em> and later as <em>What We Used to Say</em>. There are plenty more: <em>Lolita</em>, <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, <em>Pinocchio</em> and <em>Lo strano caso del Dottor Jekyll e del Signor Hyde</em> are just a few examples. the style of these readings includes musical interludes and musical settings in the background.</p>
 <p>As I write this, the current reading, A.S Byatt's <strong><em>La Vergine nel Giardino</em></strong>, <em>The Virgin in the Garden</em>, is available as a podcast, either at the RAI 3 site or at iTunes, but I didn't find any other readings available in this form. You can subscribe to current shows.</p>
 <p>Any of these programs will give you much more Italian than your average Italian station, likely to be giving heavy airplay to American and British pop hits.</p>
