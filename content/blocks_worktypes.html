<perch:help>
This page can show ay given type of work; one project can be followed by another. It is designed for a main image with some text and accompanying detail images. <br>
A main image for each example can be chosen. The choices are listed in a row at the red arrow. Images can have captions and copyright information.<br> Options are for <br>1) a full page width headline image; <br>2) a tall image spanning one column and two rows, with the accompanying text two columns wide; <br>3) an image and text arranged horizontally 1:1;, and <br>4) an image and text arranged horizontally 2(image):1(text).<br>
The tall image option (2) permits detail photos in the two-column text section, or this can be skipped and detailed images can be added under the main photo and text and spanning all three columns of the page.<br>
The order of image and text can also be reversed to give variety and separation to examples presented.<br><br>
We don't want captions too much wider than the image they explain. Insert a break tag where the additional line should begin. Here is a break tag: &lt;br&gt;
